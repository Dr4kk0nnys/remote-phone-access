# How it's going to work
We will use the handy [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy), some useful resources, such as nmap, and other stuff.  
It will use TypeScript, but I pretend in doing another repository like this, but this time using python3.  
Also, as a matter of fact, it will use quite a lot of linux terminal commands, I will cover the usage, and why to use it, but it wouldn't hurt knowing at least the basics.  

# Dependencies
1. [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)
    * `sudo apt install scrcpy`
1. [nmap](https://nmap.org/)
    * `sudo apt install nmap`
1. [adb](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/)
    * `sudo apt install adb`
1. [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Usage
I just recently broke my phone's display, the touch works, but the image doesn't ( the phone's screen is black ). I tried many ways to have access to my phone, and being honest, there's a lot of great ways of achieving so.  
1. [airdroid](web.airdroid.com) Let's you do a bunch of stuff
1. The good old way of just plugging your phone on the usb and getting the files back ( although that doesn't grant me any control over the phone ).
1. [and other great ways](https://www.androidauthority.com/control-android-from-pc-854442/)
1. [mirroring your phone's screen](https://www.howtogeek.com/430466/how-to-mirror-and-control-your-android-phone-on-any-windows-pc/)
  
And the list goes on and on ...
